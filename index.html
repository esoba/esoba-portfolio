								<h3>Education</h3>
								<p>For both my graduate and undergraduate eductation, I attended the University of Michigan. In undergrad I majored in Biomedical Engineering and minored in Electrical Engineering.
									During my junior year, I took a class in signal processing that exposed me to some concepts in Machine Learning and I quickly realized that it was an area I wanted to pursue as a career. 
									This was also around the time that the COVID-19 pandemic had hit and the US was going into quarantine, so with the extra time I had in the summer I decided to self-teach myself Python and Machine Learning.
									Wanting to advance my understanding, I applied and got into the SUGS program which allowed me to do a 1 years Masters in Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning. 
									Relevant course work I have/am completed/completing previously include:
									<ul>
										<li>EECS 551 (Matrix Methods for Machine Learning)</li>
										<li>EECS 545 (Machine Learning)</li>
										<li>EECS 501 (Probability & Random Processes)</li>
										<li>EECS 351 (Digital Signal Processing)</li>
										<li>Data Structures & Algorithms (Self-taught)</li>
										<li>Computer Vision (Self-taught)</li>
									  </ul>
								</p>
								  <p>
									  In addition to coursework, I was an Instructional Aide for BME 241 (Statistics, Computation, & Data Analysis).
									  My role was to help a class of ~100 students BME students understand the basics of statistics and how to perform 
									  those analyses with Python. Finally, I have been on the Deans List every year of undergrad, was a James B. Angel scholar, and 
									  graduated Magna Cum Laude with a major GPA of 3.9. Go Blue!

								<h3>Googliness</h3>
								<p>Throughout my educational career, I have always had a hard time deciding what I wanted to make a career out of. No matter what I decided to do, I always had one goal in mind: make a meaningful impact on people.
									I believe Google is the best place to achieve this goal because of their outreach. With so many products spanning so many different industries Google does nothing but help people across the globe. The prospect of working 
									with some of the smartest minds in the world and putting into production products that people interact with on a daily basis excites me more than anything. I had the opportunity to be apart of Google's CS Research Mentorship program
									and I have seen first hand how much Google cares about helping people succeed. I want to succeed with Google, and I will use all the Googliness I have to make sure that I do!

								<h3><a href="#">Evaluating the Stability of Non-Adaptive Trading in Continuous Double Auctions</a></h3>
								<p>
									I am working with the Strategic Reasoning Group (SRG) through the University of Michigan CSE department on a replication paper that explores Reinforcement Learning agents in a simulated stock market. My responsibilities include rewriting existing code in tensorflow, interacting with a Java based market simulator, and training a Deep Q-Learning agent to pick optimal parameters for trading. 
									Since starting the project, I have: designed a Zero Intelligence agent that trades using a dummy policy based on private evaluations of securities, created functions to bin and parse data from simulated market, and designed a Tabular Q agent that continously learns and trades in the market using an epsilon greedy policy. All of the work so far has been done in tensorflow with python and 
									Java. My next steps are to perform a a parameter sweep on the University of Michigan's supercomputer cluster and begin designing the DQN agent.

								<h3><a href="#">Dorsch Heart Failure</a></h3>
								<p>I worked with the Dorsch Heart Failure Project performing time series statistical analysis on 43 patients who currently suffer from symptoms of heart failure. The purpose of the project was to see whether daily self monitoring of symptoms can lead to proper medical intervention before symptoms worsen. I created a model to predict a given patient's well being based on previous day(s) data and visualizations of patient statistics.
									This was my first exposure to working with messy data sets and performing a lot of data engineering. I trained a suite of binary classification models (including Random Forests, SVMs, and decision trees) and used cross validation to determine that a SVM with RBF kernel was the best classifier for this dataset (with ROC AUC metric). Before my time with the project ended, I was able to achieve a 91% accuracy on the training data
									and 75% accuracy on the testing data. All analyses were done using scikit-learn, matplotlib, and pandas.

								<h3><a href="#">Smart Recognition of Neurosurgical Tools</a></h3>
								<p>Through the University of Michigan College of Engineering Multidisciplinary Design Program, myself and a team of 5 other Michigan students worked for Stryker to design a system that automatically recognized neurosurgical tool attachment combinations. The goal of the project was to decrease the workflow during surgery that occurs because of the need to calibrate parameters of different tools. I worked on the Computer Vision side of the project, where we used Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Amazon EC2 private GPU servers to create an image recognition system for burs/attachments (the components of the tool). We achieved a maximum of 95% validation accuracy on a dataset that is comprised of both original pictures as well as augmented ones. We approached this multi-class computer vision problem by using convolutional neural networks built on top of the ImageNet 2014 winning VGG16 architecture.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Youtube Ranking Algorithm Literature Review</a></h3>
								<p>In my EECS 545 class, I was tasked with reseraching a current application in Machine Learning and writing a review of the techniques that were employed. I decided to take this a step further and 
									implement the algorithm in an attempt to understand the techniques better. In this project, I reviewed and reimplemented the algorithm to rank videos based on search in tensorflow and keras.
