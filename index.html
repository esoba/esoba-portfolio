								<h1>Hi. I'm <strong>Elijah Soba</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am an Associate Data-scientist at Deloitte working out of their NYC office in the Risk & Financial Advisory department. I graduated magna cum laude from the University of Michigan in 2021 with a Bachelors in Biomedical/Electrical Engineering and again in 2022 with a Masters in Signal/Image Processing and Machine Learning.</p>

								<h3>Education</h3>
								<p>I attended the University of Michigan as a first generation, Latino American student and graduated as an James B Angel scholar with a major GPA of 3.9. I participated in the Society of Hispanic Engineers (SHPE) and in my final year was apart of the '21 Google CS mentorship cohort. 
									Notable classes that I took in my time at Michigan include: Machine Learning, Matrix Methods for Signal Processing and Machine Learning, Probability and Random Processes, Machine Learning/Data Science Design Lab, and Data Structures and Algorithms. Go Blue!

								<h3>Why Deloitte?</h3>
								<p>Throughout my educational career, I have always had a hard time deciding what I wanted to make a career out of. No matter what I decided to do, I always had one goal in mind: make a meaningful impact on people.
									I believe Deloitte is the best place to achieve this goal because of their people, culture, and outreach.
									Because Deloitte has many clients that are scattered around many different industries, it gives me the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects with many people.
									Specifically, I will be working in the AI center of excellence developing more long term deep learning oriented solutions to client problems.
									I find comfort knowing that the work that I do will not be static, and opportunities to contribute will always arise. Deep learning has always been an interest of mine, and I look forward to being able to work on these types of projects with some of the brightest minds in the industry!

								<h3><a href="https://ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2018/pdfs/p614.pdf">Evaluating the Stability of Non-Adaptive Trading in Continuous Double Auctions</a></h3>
								<p>
									I am working with the Strategic Reasoning Group (SRG) through the University of Michigan CSE department on a replication paper that explores Reinforcement Learning agents in a simulated stock market. My responsibilities include rewriting existing code in tensorflow, interacting with a Java based market simulator, and training a Deep Q-Learning agent to pick optimal parameters for trading. 
									Since starting the project, I have designed a Zero Intelligence agent that trades using a dummy policy based on private evaluations of securities, created functions to bin and parse data from simulated market, designed a Tabular Q agent that continously learns and trades in the market, and developed a Deep Q Network Agent to improve on the tabular benchmark. 
									In addition, I gained valuable experience using slurm and the University supercomputing resources to train on a GPU.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/esoba/Dorsch-HF">Dorsch Heart Failure</a></h3>
								<p>I worked with the Dorsch Heart Failure Project performing time series statistical analysis on 43 patients who currently suffer from symptoms of heart failure. The purpose of the project was to see whether daily self monitoring of symptoms can lead to proper medical intervention before symptoms worsen. I created a model to predict a given patient's well being based on previous day(s) data and visualizations of patient statistics.
									This was my first exposure to working with messy data sets and performing a lot of data engineering. I trained a suite of binary classification models (including Random Forests, SVMs, and decision trees) and used cross validation to determine that a SVM with RBF kernel was the best classifier for this dataset (with ROC AUC metric). Before my time with the project ended, I was able to achieve a 91% accuracy on the training data
									and 75% accuracy on the testing data. All analyses were done using scikit-learn, matplotlib, and pandas.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/esoba/Smart-Recognition-Neurosurgical-Tools">Smart Recognition of Neurosurgical Tools</a></h3>
								<p>Through the University of Michigan College of Engineering Multidisciplinary Design Program, myself and a team of 5 other Michigan students worked for Stryker to design a system that automatically recognized neurosurgical tool attachment combinations. The goal of the project was to decrease the workflow during surgery that occurs because of the need to calibrate parameters of different tools. I worked on the Computer Vision side of the project, where we used Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Amazon EC2 private GPU servers to create an image recognition system for burs/attachments (the components of the tool). We achieved a maximum of 95% validation accuracy on a dataset that is comprised of both original pictures as well as augmented ones. We approached this multi-class computer vision problem by using convolutional neural networks built on top of the ImageNet 2014 winning VGG16 architecture.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/esoba/eecs545project">Recommender Systems Literature Review</a></h3>
								<p>In my EECS 545 class, I was tasked with reseraching a current application in Machine Learning and writing a review of the techniques that were employed. I decided to do Recommender Systems as my application of choice,
									and in the literature review detailed the basics of recommender system theory and discussed what techniques were being used in the current state of the art. Methods that I researched include Graph Neural Networks, Mixture of Experts, Multi-Armed Bandits, Matrix Factorization, and Causal Inference.

								<h3><a href="#">Segmentation2Image Translation with cGAN</a></h3>
								<p>In my EECS 545 class, I was tasked with replicating a prominent Machine Learning paper and applying it to a different dataset. My team and I chose pix2pix and attempted to apply it to an MRI dataset to determine if segmentations of tumors could be translated into MRI images. 
									We reimplemented the entire architecture from scratch in Pytorch, and I was specifically in charge of developing evaluation metrics for the cGAN. The metrics that we used were FCN score, Inception Score, and FID score.
